# Introduction 
This work proposed a deep learning model that is capable of detecting the working condition (On - Off) of five appliances, including air conditioner, electric vehicle charger, oven, cloth washer and dryer. 

## Installation
To run the program, some libraries are required.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install some python packages:

```bash
pip install ...

```


As Pytorch allow us to train the model using GPU, which is much faster than the current CPU performance. To start, you will need the GPU version of Pytorch, and please make sure that your computer has a higher end NVIDIA GPU that is CUDA enabled.



## Usage
To reproduce the model, the first Jupyter Notebook file that should be run is: "CNN_model_training"
After installing all the required packages, you can simply hit the Kernel -> Restart and Run All

```python

```
